*****************************
Description:\
This browser-based application provides a Sudoku board pre-populated
with a game of sudoku which can be played by using the number buttons
below the grid. Selecting a button will allow the user to insert the 
associated value into a grid cell on the board by clicking within any 
of the cells. The program contains an algorithm which verifies the 
correctness of the board and returns a message using window.alert as 
to whether the solution is correct or not.
*****************************
Game Rules:\
The game of Sudoku is played by inserting the numbers 1 through 9 into 
a 9x9 grid of cells such that each row and column only contain a single
instance of each of the valid numbers. Additionally, the board is divided 
into 9 separate 3x3 grids commonly referred to as segments. These segments 
must also contain exactly one instance of each of the valid numbers. Thus, 
the player is provided a certain number of cells that are pre-populated 
with numbers and must attempt to infer the correct number for the remaining 
empty cells such that both conditions above hold true.
